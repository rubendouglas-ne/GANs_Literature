# GANs_Literature

## 01. Traditional GANs : to generate more datasets of peatlands as we have only small datasets.
We decided to explore this literature first and then see if we can move onto the modern collaborated GANs literature.

## 02. Modern Collaborated GANs : used for semantic segmentation
We can even use GANs for our Semantic Segmentaion
