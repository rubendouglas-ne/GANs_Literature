# GANs_Literature

## 01. Traditional GANs : to generate more datasets of peatlands as we have only small datasets.
We decided to explore this literature first and then see if we can move onto the modern collaborated GANs literature.

### From the team
01.Generating synthetic multispectral satellite imagery from sentinel-2
02.Data augmentation using CycleGANs to improve CT segmentation

## 02. Modern Collaborated GANs : used for semantic segmentation
